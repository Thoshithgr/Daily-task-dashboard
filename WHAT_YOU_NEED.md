# What You Need - Complete Guide

## Summary

The app is **ready to deploy** and will work **automatically** once you provide the Supabase details. Everything is set up to connect automatically.

---

## What You Need to Provide (Just 2 Things!)

When you're ready to connect Supabase, you need to give me or Vercel these **2 values**:

### 1. SUPABASE_URL
- **What it is:** Your Supabase project URL
- **Looks like:** `https://abcdefghijklmnop.supabase.co`
- **Where to find:** Supabase → Settings → API → Project URL

### 2. SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- **What it is:** Your Supabase anonymous key
- **Looks like:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS...`
- **Where to find:** Supabase → Settings → API → anon public key

## Where to Add These in Vercel

Once you have the above 2 values:

1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Click **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Add each one as a new variable
4. Redeploy

**That's all!** The app will automatically connect.

## What Happens Automatically

Once you add those 2 environment variables to Vercel and redeploy:

✅ Authentication will use Supabase  
✅ Users can register/login  
✅ Data is stored in Supabase database  
✅ All integrations save to database  
✅ Sessions persist  
✅ Everything works without code changes  

**No backend changes needed!** It all connects automatically.
